    Vintage is a popular expression that is frequently used to refer to all old styles of clothing. 
    In its modern use, it often indicates that the item is at least 20 years old, while items a century old or more can be considered antique. 
    Today vintage dressing encompasses accessories, mixing vintage garments with new, as well as creating an ensemble of various styles and periods.
